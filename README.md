Netra3D
=======

Netra 3D is an interactive e-learning application designed to acquaint a student with the anatomy of human eye with its varied features, components
and functionality in the 3D viewscape.

The app, Netra 3D in its present form is a tracery of three stages.

Stage 1 is ‘Structure of Eye’, which shows the anatomy of the human eye in a 3D viewscape, and a practice activity section for the user to review his learning from the former. Stage 2 is 
 ‘Image Formation in Eye’ which explains how a normal eye and an eye with defects processes the landscape of vision through videos. The follow up to this is another activity that quizzes the 
user on what had been gleaned from the aforementioned. Stage 3 is ‘Stress Adaptivity of Eye’, which explains how the pupil of the eye responds to various intensities of light, and an activity 
tucked into the same premise.

FUTURE WORK:

Looking into the expansion of scope for the app, we can:

● In its present form, this app can be expanded in future scope to tack and sew more models from the human anatomy into the app territory.

● Generation of these apps using free and open source game engine/s.

● Using GameKit as a good approach to generate .apk among all the other approaches and Cocos 3D can be considered as a good platform to develop apps for ios platform as they 
are free to use. 

● Additional real time features can be added to Netra 3D, accessing the camera functionality, and imputing the same with more exploration in Unity3D.
